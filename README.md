# ML_Height_Weight Project

This project predicts a person's **weight** based on their **height** using **Simple Linear Regression**.

## Steps:
1. Loaded and explored the Height-Weight dataset.
2. Cleaned the data (checked for missing values and outliers).
3. Built a **Simple Linear Regression** model to predict weight based on height.
4. Evaluated the model's performance using common regression metrics.

## Tools and Libraries:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For analysis and code execution.
